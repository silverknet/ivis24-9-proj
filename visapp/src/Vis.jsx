Gather your sticky notes. Choose your favorite color or mix different hues for a vibrant stack.
<br/><br/>

Step 2:
Find a flat surface. A clean desk or table works best to ensure precision and ease of alignment.
<br/><br/>

Step 3:
Place one sticky note flat on the surface. This will be the base of your perfectly aligned stack. Ensure it's straight and aligned with the edge of the table for reference.
<br/><br/>

Step 4:
Carefully pick up another sticky note. Hold it by the non-sticky edge to avoid finger marks on the sticky area.
<br/><br/>

Step 5:
Hover the second note above the first. Carefully align the edges, using the table's edge as a guide for ultimate precision.
<br/><br/>

Step 6:
Gently lower the second note onto the first. Start from one side and slowly lay it down to avoid trapping air bubbles between them.
<br/><br/>

Step 7:
Press down along the edges to secure the bond. Admire your perfectly aligned stack. Repeat with additional sticky notes until your stack reaches the desired height or until you feel a profound sense of achievement.</p>
