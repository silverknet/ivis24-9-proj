								The data is gathered from different sources. There is therefore no guarantee that emissions correlate between datasets. What goes into
								each country's emissions should therefore only be considered estimates.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is also no way of calculating the exact impact of different systemic changes. For example, banning personal flights would likely lead
								to an increase in other transport methods.
							</p>
							<p>
								This feature is intended to be used to better understand where emissions come from and how they can be reduced, not as a measure of
								what different changes would do for the world.

							As a group, our main focus was to expand our knowledge of data presentation and data visualization. We wanted to get better at D3, and challenge
							ourselves in order to develop a tool that fulfilled its purpose and that we could be proud of. We have drawn inspiration from the course literature,
							visualization studies and the D3 library to achieve the site you are currently looking at.

						I was the lead in UI/UX for this project, so I spent some time with the figma protoype and the general look/feel of our application.
						On the frontend side of it all my main focus was understanding the D3 library. Some focus went in to adding multiple visualsations in the same view, 
						like the celebrity bars, but most of it went into adding interactivity to our visualization and the different data manipulation features.

						During this project I have contributed to many different parts of the frontend development. I focused a lot on getting better at D3,
						letting me parttake in many of the different features. One thing i worked on was for example the search feature, for finding/toggling
						a single country out of the dataset. I was also the lead for user testing, so I held a couple of test sessions at different points to help us better understand
						the usability of our app, and also see how people interacted with it and if they enjoyed it.

						I was the frontend lead for this project so my main task was to see that we got all the functionality in place, using prototypes/sketches made in Figma as a foundation. This included working with both React and the D3 library, along with a lot of CSS. My focus has been on developing functionality that both feel intuitive and interesting, as well as being adaptive and nice looking.

						into a functional and visually appealing web interface. Much of my work has been to explore functionality of the D3 library and enable
						extended data manipulation for the user.

						My role within the project has been lead data handler and processor. I searched for and gathered data which was suitable for our project,

						features, such as allowing the user to see and remove certain "slices" of emissions from the total, to life.
