								The data is gathered from different sources. There is therefore no guarantee that emissions correlate between datasets. What goes into
								each country's emissions should therefore only be considered estimates.
							</p>
							<p>
								There is also no way of calculating the exact impact of different systemic changes. For example, banning personal flights outright
								would likely lead to other problems, such as more emissions from people being forced to travel through energy inefficient means.
							</p>
							<p>
								This feature is intended to be used to better understand where emissions come from and how they can be reduced, not as a measure of
								what different changes would do for the world.

						I was the lead in UI/UX for this project, so I spent some time with the figma protoype and the general look/feel of our application.

						I was the frontend lead for this project so my main task was to see that we got all the functionality in place, using prototypes/sketches made in Figma as a foundation. This included working with both React and the D3 library, along with a lot of CSS. My focus has been on developing functionality that both feel intuitive and interesting, as well as being adaptive and nice looking.

						As a frontend developer for this project, my role has focused on bringing the website to life by translating design concepts and UX ideas

						My role within the project has been lead data handler and processor. I searched for and gathered data which was suitable for our project, 
						trimmed and filtered them according to the project's needs, and handled discrepencies between datasets. I also worked with bringing data-based 
						features, such as allowing the user to see and remove certain "slices" of emissions from the total, to life.
